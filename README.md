In this project, I've loaded some English Premier League Football Club's data from thesportsdb api. In the home page, 20 premier league team names with their short information like their logo and founding year is provided. There is also an "Explore" button, if someone is keen about details, they can click it, then they can know more detail information about that specific club. In the new page, club name, founding year, gender are shown, and a brief description and history about they club is mentioned. If someone wants to join the social media profile of the club, they can find official facebook, instagram and twitter page of the club given at the bottom of the page.
